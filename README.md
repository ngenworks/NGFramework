### Adding NGFramework to your project

This repository is currently not in a state of framework isolation, so please feel free to use the classes and their dependencies to your convenience.  We are in the process of identifying what we want to include in this core framework and will be releasing it on Cocopods as soon as it's ready in the coming weeks.
